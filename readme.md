# Hero Guesser

Welcome to Hero Guesser! This is an open-source fan project inspired by the popular word game Wordle, but featuring Dota 2 heroes.

Currently live here: [https://saint11.github.io/HeroGuesser/](https://saint11.github.io/HeroGuesser/)

Originally inspired by playing [Dotadle](https://dotadle.net/) and wanting different stats (and for it to be open source with no ads).
